# EverydayBudget

EverydayBudget is a simple monthly budgeting application built on Rails and React.

[Demo site!](https://everydaybudget.herokuapp.com/)

* The app works by allowing the user to record their income and expenses, using them to compute a budget for the day. 
* Staying under budget will increase the daily budget for other days of the month. Going under it will decrease it. 
* Reducing a month's budget to a single day reduces the cognitive load of budgeting. 
* The app also allows the user to review expenses and sources of income for a particular month, and includes support for recurring expenses and one-time payments.
