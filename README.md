# EverydayBudget

EverydayBudget is a simple monthly budgeting application built on Rails and React. It makes budgeting simple by reducing a monthly budget to the average amount you can spend on any given day.

* The app works by allowing the user to record their income and expenses, using them to compute a budget for the day. 
* Staying under budget will increase the daily budget for subsequent days of the month. Going over it will reduce it. 
* The app also displays expenses and sources of income for a particular month, and includes support for recurring expenses and one-time payments.
